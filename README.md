### Project Overview
InstaSalud is an application currently under development, aimed at optimizing access to healthcare services in clinics and hospitals across the Dominican Republic. The primary goal of this project is to streamline the process of scheduling and managing medical appointments, thereby reducing wait times for both patients and healthcare professionals. This is the mobile version of the project.

#### Problem Statement
According to an internal study conducted among young adults aged 18 to 30 years old who attend general and specialized medical consultations in the Santo Domingo region, patients face significant wait times before being attended to, with a median wait time of 5 hours (average of 5.3 Â± 2.5 hours). More than 50% of the respondents indicated that these prolonged wait periods negatively impact their overall perception of the quality of medical care.

#### Proposed Solution
InstaSalud will be an application designed to simplify the process of scheduling and managing medical appointments. This tool will be available to all beneficiaries who possess a social security number issued by the Dominican government, encompassing both public and private healthcare services.

#### Key Features
- User Registration: Users can create accounts and link them to their social security numbers for secure access.
- Appointment Scheduling: Users can easily search for and book appointments with various medical professionals across multiple healthcare facilities.
- Appointment Management: Users can view, modify, or reschedule their upcoming appointments.
- Medical History: Users can securely store and access their medical records, test results, and other relevant health information.
- Doctor Portal: Healthcare professionals can manage their schedules, view patient profiles, and update medical records within the application.
- Notifications and Reminders: The application will send automated reminders and notifications to patients and doctors to prevent missed appointments.
